# Overview

A simple web application that detects human poses from uploaded images and generates a 3D skeleton visualization using MediaPipe.

# Features

- **Pose Detection**: Upload an image to automatically detect human pose and generate a 3D skeleton
- **3D Visualization**: View the detected pose as a 3D skeleton that matches the pose in your image
- **Background Display**: The uploaded image is displayed as a background for easy comparison

# Usage

1. Click the "Detect From Image" button
2. Select an image file containing a person
3. Wait for the pose detection to process
4. View the generated 3D skeleton overlaid on your image

**Note**: For best results, use photos with clearly visible human figures. Anime or cartoon characters may not work correctly.
